# Letter for Led-Cube
This code contains the code equivalent of the alphabet for printing on 8*8*8 Led-Cube.

### The story of this project
For my project assignment in 2018, I needed to flow letters in the order of the Led Earrings.
I could not find a website with all the letters. I only [had numbers and code equivalent](https://youtu.be/T5Aq7cRc-mU?t=396):

So I tried reverse engineering methods to find out which letter each led corresponds to:

It was an amazing process that cost me 6 hours.
